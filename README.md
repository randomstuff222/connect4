## Overview

### Continued development
The initial Scope was to have a working game using react and javascript, which was accomplished
For the future scope:
This project is in development, at the moment it can be play locally with another player by taking turns, 
but in the future it would have the feature to be play online with a friend, and play against the cpu.
Initially started following inspiration from FEM website, but deviated to make it more of my own.

What I learned:
I was able to implement my React knowledge, and add animations for css elements for the piece drop.


### The challenge

Built with ReactJS, this project is a connect four game that allows human player vs. human player gameplay (alternating turns on the same computer). The project was a Frontend Mentor challenge with the goal of building the game and getting it as close to the provided design specs as possible. While the player vs. player version is complete, Player vs. CPU mode will be in version 2 of the project.

Users should be able to:

- View the game rules
- Play a game of Connect Four against another human player (alternating turns on the same computer)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- See the discs animate into their position when a move is made
